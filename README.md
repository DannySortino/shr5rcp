=====================


1. Overview

 This is a program to manage resources and characters for the rolegame shadowrun 5.0.
 It is dedicated to create and manage characters. 


 
2. Motivation
  
 As I used to play shadowrun for a very long time, I started with an editor in Delphi for shadowrun 2.0, 
 many year later I started a technologie study with emf for the 3.01 version, as my group has now moved
 to 5.0 and the chummer project don't work well on linux I have moved some of the model to 5.0. This is
 a kind of technology study, working with an model driven approach.

3. Installation

 As the software is an eclipse product so you need to unpack the software and start the exe, you will need java installed.
 
4. Technical stuff

 This project is based on the EMF modeling framework.
